title: Neonatal Quiz
---
body:

The following scenarios or similar events are encountered relatively frequently by practitioners working with high-risk neonatal cases. Most of the scenarios are based on real situations encountered by the author. Brief descriptions of the cases are followed by multiple choice questions. Answers are given along with brief explanations on the next page. In the first four scenarios the answers are 'clickable' and give you feedback if your answer is correct or not. This was not continued later for technical reasons (too many links to create). 

One may argue that some of the questions are obvious and too easy to answer; however, in neonatology most clinical errors are made when obvious issues are disregarded. 

The author welcomes any comments or suggestions. I also welcome new questions or scenarios. You can contact me via this e-mail: gbelteki@aol.com
